# Lebron-Fanpage
My interest in Computer Science started in middle school but finally manifested in high school where I was given the opportunity to create my own classes in the form of Independent Studies. My first Independent Study was oriented around HTML and CSS, and my knowledge was showcased through a website I had created, a fan page for LeBron James.
